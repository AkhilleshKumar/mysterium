# Lasercut Acrylic Case with POM Plate

##This is case is OPTIONAL and not required. The kit has everything you need for a fully functional keyboard.
***This case uses a different plate and is NOT compatible with the plate included in the kit.
If you have already soldered switches, you will need to desolder them and swap the plate.***

***I recommend using [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com) to cut the pieces. They have all of the correct/required thicknesses and materials in stock and have the best pricing that I have found for multiple one-off parts. Use clear acrylic for the full range of thickness options and Delrin (POM) for the plate. For proper fit please ensure you use the correct dimensions and material thicknesses noted below. If you would like to change the color you may change out any of the 3mm thick acrylic pieces. The 2mm and 4.5mm parts are only offered in clear acrylic from Ponoko.***
